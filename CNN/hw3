Overview

In this homework, we will explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We'll explore the mechanics of convolutional operations, will build a CNN to classify CIFAR-10 images, and will build a CNN for detecting gravitational waves from the LIGO observatory. Specifically, we will use images generated from the raw time series data to train a model that can distinguish between real gravitational events and noise.
